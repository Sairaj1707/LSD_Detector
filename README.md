# Lumpy Skin Disease Detection System

Our project focuses on leveraging image analysis techniques to develop an automated system for detecting lumpy skin disease (LSD) in dairy animals. By capturing high-resolution images of affected areas on the animals, preprocessing them for quality enhancement, extracting relevant features using computer vision algorithms, and training machine learning models, we aim to enable early and accurate detection of LSD. This approach not only streamlines the detection process but also minimizes the need for manual inspection, ultimately contributing to improved disease management and animal welfare in dairy farms.
